    abstract = {Pansharpening aims to sharpen a low-resolution multispectral ({MS}) image through a high-resolution single-channel panchromatic ({PAN}) image to obtain a high-resolution multi-spectral ({HRMS}) image. However, low correlation between the {PAN} and {MS} images, as well as the inaccurate detail injection for each band of {MS} image are the key problems causing spectral and spatial distortions in pansharpening. To address these issues, a new pansharpening method based on the intensity mixture and band-adaptive detail fusion is proposed. To obtain a mixed-intensity image (T) that has a high correlation with the {MS} image and maintain the gradient information of the {PAN} image, the intensity mixture model is constructed by establishing the intensity and gradient constraints between T and the source images. As it is hard to obtain a proper degradation filter in the model, a filter estimation algorithm is designed by the distribution alignment. To inject the details that match the point spread function of the sensor, a band-adaptive detail fusion algorithm is presented to fuse the details extracted from T with those from the {MS} image for each band. Furthermore, as there are far fewer details in the {MS} image than in T, a detail enhancement algorithm is proposed to enhance the details proportionally. The final {HRMS} image is obtained by injecting the fused details into the upsampled {MS} image. Extensive experiments show that the proposed method can efficiently achieve the best results in fusion quality compared to state-of-the-art methods.
